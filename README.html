<h1 id="cgdh-tools">CGDH Tools</h1>
<p>Computer generated display holography (CGDH) tools is a set of 
Octave/MATLAB/Scilab functions and demos. They show basic procedures in CGDH 
and computational Fourier optics.</p>
<p>The code is mainly <strong>educational</strong>. Those who want to understand computer 
generated display holography are encouraged to read the code of the demos
and the CGDH core functions. The code tries to be as simple and readable as 
possible. Thus, it does not contain optimizations that would obfuscate 
principles; the only exception is that the code tries to use matrix operations
whenever possible as Octave/MATLAB/Scilab is optimized for matrices. 
Anyone who needs high performance should adjust or rewrite the scripts
according to particular needs.</p>
<p>The code is published under 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT License</a>.</p>

<p>CGDH Tools were officialy introduced at the conference 
&quot;11th International Symposium on Display Holography (ISDH 2018)&quot;.
Preprint of the conference article can be downloaded

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>The main development platform is Octave (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/</a>). 
The code (.m files) is fully compatible with MATLAB. The code is also 
provided in Scilab syntax (.sci and .sce files). </p>
<p>The Octave code was developed in version 4.x. It was tested in version 4.4. 
Version 4.2 should work fine.</p>
<p>The code was tested in MATLAB R2017a. It should work with most MATLAB versions.</p>
<p>The Scilab code was tested in version 6.0.1 (<a href="https://www.scilab.org/">https://www.scilab.org/</a>).
It <strong>requires</strong> module IPCV 1.2 (Image Processing and Computer Vision 
Toolbox for Scilab, <a href="http://atoms.scilab.org/toolboxes/IPCV/1.2">http://atoms.scilab.org/toolboxes/IPCV/1.2</a>, 
<a href="http://scilabipcv.tritytech.com">http://scilabipcv.tritytech.com</a>) for image loading and saving. </p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>CGDH Tools is built around demos. Currently available are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Propagation of light between parallel planes. Implemented methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li>convolution in the spatial domain (Rayleigh-Sommerfeld, Fresnel, etc.),</li><li>convolution in the frequency domain (angular spectrum, Fresnel, etc.),</li><li>Fourier transform based (Fresnel, Fraunhofer).</li></ul>
</li><li><p>Simulation of a simple digital hologram recording and its reconstruction.
Provided demos show hologram of an image and of a simple point cloud. 
They also simulate a real image reconstruction as well as a photographing
of a reconstructed virtual image.<br>The demos also show various hologram recording setups (on-axis, off-axis,
lensless Fourier), hologram encoding methods (interference based, bipolar
intensity, kinoform, etc.) and hologram manipulation (bleaching, 
binarization).  </p>
</li><li><p>Calculation of a &quot;layered hologram&quot;. A 3-D scene is decomposed to a set
of parallel layers (billboards). The calculation solves hidden surface
elimination.</p>
</li><li><p>Hologram of a point cloud using a naive method and using a wavefront recording
plane.</p>
</li><li><p>Holographic stereogram of a point cloud. The demo allows to compare various
approaches (basic, phase added stereogram - PAS, compensated phase added
stereogram - CPAS, accurate phase added stereogram - APAS, accurate 
compensated phase added stereogram - ACPAS).</p>
</li><li><p>In addition, there are three self-contained demos (they do not use CGDH Tools
functionality) that show basic procedures in computer generated display 
holography.</p>
</li></ul>
<h2 id="example-output">Example output</h2>
<p>Following images were calculated using Octave 4.4.0. They show a geometrical
image of a layered scene (stack of three parallel billboards), their
off-axis hologram encoded with bipolar intensity scheme, and its real image
reconstruction.</p>
<p><img src="example_output/layered-fig1.png" alt=""><br><em>The scene and its reconstruction from a hologram</em></p>
<p><img src="example_output/layered-fig2.png" alt=""><br><em>The calculated hologram</em></p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>The demos are located in the numbered folders. It is recommended to explore them
in that order. The core functionality is in the folder <code>cgdhtools</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>01_standalone_demos</code><br>Three standalone demos that do not use CGDH Tools functionality. Those that
have little experience with computational Fourier optics should explore them
first as they directly show the calculations. In the other demos, most 
calculations are &quot;hidden&quot; in the functions of CGDH Tolls.</p>
</li><li><p><code>02_simple_examples</code><br>The basic usage of CGDH Tools. The demos are as short as possible. 
It is highly recommended to explore these demos first.</p>
</li><li><p><code>03_demo_basic_functions</code><br>Computational Fourier optics uses many special complex valued functions. This
demo allows to explore them. It is quite safe to skip this demo if you are
not interested in calculation details.</p>
</li><li><p><code>04_demo_propagation</code><br>Examples of light propagation between parallel planes. As light propagation 
simulation is an ubiquitous part of computational Fourier optics and
computational holography, it is highly recommended to explore these demos.</p>
</li><li><p><code>05_demo_digital_hologram</code><br>Simulation of recording a digital hologram of a flat image and of a simple 
point cloud. The demos show how to reconstruct a real image and how to take
a photograph of a virtual image. Moreover, it is possible to compare
various hologram recording setups (on-axis, off-axis, lensless Fourier), 
hologram encoding methods (classical interference based, bipolar intensity,
kinoform, etc.) and hologram processing (binarization, bleaching). Finally, 
there is a demo that calculates a diffractive optical element (DOE) that 
projects an image to a specified distance.  </p>
</li><li><p><code>06_demo_layered_hologram</code><br>Hologram of a layered scene (scene decomposed to a stack of parallel 
billboards). The demo shows the simplest method how to handle visibility. </p>
</li><li><p><code>07_demo_hologramPointCloud</code><br>Hologram of a point cloud. The demo allows to compare speed of the naive 
calculation and the calculation using a wavefront recording plane. </p>
</li><li><p><code>08_demo_stereogram</code><br>Calculation of a holographic stereogram. The demo allows to compare various
approaches (basic, phase added stereogram - PAS, compensated phase added
stereogram - CPAS, accurate phase added stereogram - APAS, accurate 
compensated phase added stereogram - ACPAS).</p>
</li><li><p><code>cgdhtools</code><br>The core functionality.</p>
</li><li><p><code>development</code><br>Utilities used in CGDH Tools development </p>
</li><li><p><code>example_output</code><br>The images that were referenced in the section Example output.</p>
</li><li><p><code>images</code><br>Some input images that are used in the demos.</p>
</li></ul>
