First steps in computer generated display holography can be difficult for both 
students, researchers and engineers. One of the main reasons is that in order to 
make a computer generated hologram, one has to implement the whole chain that 
calculates optical fields, makes a hologram and allows to simulate its 
reconstruction. 

The aim of CGDH Tools is to provide the basic building blocks of such a chain 
and to show a few case studies that demonstrate step by step how to use them. 
CGDH Tools is a set of Octave/MATLAB/Scilab functions and scripts that try to be 
as simple and clear as possible; moreover, they are extensively documented. 

The functionality includes light propagation calculations (convolution based, 
angular spectrum based and single Fourier transform based with optional local 
frequency clipping), object wave calculations (point cloud, wavefront recording 
plane, stereogram, billboard based method, etc.), hologram observation 
simulation and various handy utilities. 

CGDH Tools can be used for teaching holography or wave optics, for simple 
diffractive optical element design or it can be used as a starting point when 
implementing advanced calculation methods.
